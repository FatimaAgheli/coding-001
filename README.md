# coding-001 - fatima's coding work with Eric Lau as mentor.

## poker assignment, part 1
1. Complete Card class so it is fully functional
   1. `__init__` must accept a number or a string, as instructed
   1. You are not allowed to change the method signatures of the Card or the Deck class
1. Complete Deck class so it is fully functional
   1. Randomizes a deck of cards on initialization, no repeats
   1. As cards are dealt, they are removed from the deck
   1. Can specify specific cards to be dealt, which becomes important in part 2 of the poker assignment
1. Create unit tests for all the class functions above (even ones you didn't write yourself) to proof they are working as intended
   1. I created Card_test.py to give you a template to start with, and of course the unit test included fails, and will continue to fail until you complete the Card class portion of the assignment. Visual studio code has capability to run all or some unit tests, as well as debug an unit test.
   1. All test files must obey rule where file name ends with _test.py. Otherwise it won't be recognized as a test by Visual Studio Code.

## poker assignment, part 2
* TBD
